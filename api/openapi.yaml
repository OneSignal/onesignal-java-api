        Tags added through the Android SDK tagging methods may not update if using\
        \ the API to change or update the same tag.\nFor example, if you use SDK method\
        \ sendTag(\"key\", \"value1\") then update the tag value to \"value2\" with\
        \ this API endpoint. You will not be able to set the value back to \"value1\"\
        \ through the SDK, you will need to change it to something different through\
        \ the SDK to be reset.\nRecommendations if using this Endpoint on Android\
        \ Mobile Apps:\n1 - Do not use the same tag keys for SDK and API updates\n\
        2 - If you want to use the same key for both SDK and API updates, call the\
        \ SDK getTags method first to update the device's tags.\nThis is only applicable\
        \ on the Android Mobile App SDKs.\n&#128216;\nDeleting Tags\nTo delete a tag,\
        \ include its key and set its value to blank. Omitting a key/value will not\
        \ delete it.\nFor example, if I wanted to delete two existing tags rank and\
        \ category while simultaneously adding a new tag class, the tags JSON would\
        \ look like the following:\n\"tags\": {\n   \"rank\": \"\",\n   \"category\"\
